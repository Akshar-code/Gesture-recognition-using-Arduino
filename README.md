In this project, i used 2 Ultrasonic sensors, Arduino and Python to build an application for comfortable video streaming using VLC
Load Arduino with the code given in the txt file.
Then install all the python libraries required and ensure you are using the correct python version.
There you go, this should work perfectly fine :)
